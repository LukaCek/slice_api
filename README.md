# Print Price Calculator

> **Note:** This project is in the early stages of development. Features may change, and occasional instability is expected.

This project is a web application built with Python and the Flask framework, which functions as a price calculator for 3D printing. It allows users to upload 3D models in `.stl` format, and the application uses OrcaSlicer to calculate the estimated printing time, material consumption, and based on this data, estimates the final printing price.

The application is available at: **printprice.cekluka.com** [view](https://printprice.cekluka.com)

Current settings on this website are from the files dir. Because I couldn't figure out how to use custom parameters.


## Features

*   **STL File Upload:** Users can upload their 3D models through the web interface.
*   **Print Quality Selection:** Option to choose between different print quality profiles, which affect time and price.
*   **Automatic Slicing:** OrcaSlicer runs in the background to prepare the model for printing.
*   **Detailed Price Calculation:** The price is composed of several components:
    *   Material cost (PLA, PETG)
    *   Cost of consumed electricity
    *   Printer maintenance cost
    *   Printer amortization
    *   Minimum service fee
*   **Various Output Formats:** After calculation, the user can receive:
    *   A detailed analysis of the price and printing time (web page).
    *   A prepared `.3mf` file.
    *   A generated `G-code` file.
    *   Data in `JSON` format.

## Technologies

*   **Backend:** Python, Flask
*   **Slicer:** OrcaSlicer
*   **Frontend:** HTML, Jinja2
*   **Hosting:** Docker, Google Cloud Run

## Local Installation and Setup

To run the project in a local environment, you need Python, Flask, and OrcaSlicer installed.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/LukaCek/slice_api.git
    cd slice_api
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install Flask
    ```

3.  **Install OrcaSlicer:**
    Follow the installation instructions on the official OrcaSlicer website. Make sure the `orcaslicer` command is available in your system's PATH.

4.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
    The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:8080`.


## TODO

Here are some planned features and improvements:

*   **Material Selection:** Implement a feature to allow users to select the printing material settings.
*   **Advanced Slicing Parameters:** Expose more slicing parameters to the user, such as layer height, infill percentage, support settings, etc., for more granular control over the print.
